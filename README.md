# Project Description
Mobile applications access the internet all the time. But unlike browsers, which constantly and automatically check websites’ certificates and hostname, mobile applications do not always do so. This could lead to serious security problems. 

**Mobile-Guard** enhances mobile security by checking websites’ certificates and other security licenses whenever any user-allowed mobile application attempts to access internet, and warning users about any unsecure connections.
Mobile-Guard will validate websites’ certificates and their hostnames so that the user is guaranteed to communicate with a trusted site. Rather than securing the connection, Mobile-Guard establishes a warning system to enhance user’s awareness of their internet security.
